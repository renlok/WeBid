# WeBid
forked from the official webid fork, provides better support for themses and many bug fixes


I have a project at work which will require this so I have forked WeBid, making all my imporovements public so that the community can beneift
also check out my Metro theme which I am building


so far I have added the option to disable shipping, as my site will be selling items whcih are virtual in nature theres no need for shipping costs

Ive also made it so you can choose a different logo easily however does not allow for uploading them
